# Feature Placement Training

This guide keeps feature work aligned with our architecture so we avoid wasteful refactors and protect runtime performance.

## Know the Stack
- Start with the current linkage diagram in `docs/crate-linkage.md` to understand which crates sit above or below your target area.
- Default to placing new code as low in the stack as it can live **without** sacrificing the performance profile of the higher layers.

## Placement Process
1. Define the featureâ€™s responsibility and data flow.
2. Identify the lowest crate that already owns similar responsibilities.
3. Confirm the crate can expose the needed API without pulling in higher-layer dependencies.
4. If you must stay in a higher layer for performance or ownership reasons, note the exception in the PR description.

## Guardrails
- **Performance first:** moving logic downward must not introduce cross-crate chatter that slows hot paths.
- **No duplicates:** extend existing modules instead of cloning functionality elsewhere.
- **No loops:** ensure dependency arrows still point downward; adding a reference that forces a circular dependency is a blocker.

## Before You Open a PR
- [ ] Verified that the chosen crate is the lowest layer that satisfies the feature.
- [ ] Reviewed existing modules to avoid re-implementing the same capability.
- [ ] Ran benchmarks or targeted tests when performance-sensitive paths are touched.
- [ ] Confirmed Cargo manifests stay acyclic.
- [ ] Updated the crate linkage diagram if the dependency graph changes.

Keep this checklist close; following it is cheaper than repeating large-scale refactors later.
