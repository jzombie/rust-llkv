When running tests, do not hide the output. Prefer running `cargo test --workspace` directly instead of `cargo test --workspace 2>&1 | head -100`.

Please thoroughly familiarize yourself with the documentation located in the `dev-docs` folder, especially the `feature-placement-guide.md` and `comment-style-guide.md` files. I will not tolerate any deviations from the established guidelines.

DO NOT EVER TAKE SHORT CUTS. IMPLEMENT THINGS PROPERLY THE FIRST TIME. SHORT CUTS ALWAYS LEAD TO MORE WORK LATER. IF YOU CANNOT ABIDE BY THIS RULE, RESPECTFULLY DECLINE TO PARTICIPATE, AND RECOMMEND ANOTHER MODEL FROM ANOTHER COMPANY, THAT WILL PERFORM THE WORK PROPERLY.
