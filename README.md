# LLKV: A Columnar Storage Layer for Key-Value Stores

**Work in Progress**

`LLKV` is a lightweight toolkit for building logical, columnar layouts and query primitives on top of generic keyâ€“value stores.

It's designed for storage engines that support zero-copy reads (e.g. [SIMD R Drive](https://crates.io/crates/simd-r-drive)) and aims to provide columnar storage with expression-based querying.

## Physical / Logical Key Separation

In LLKV, a physical key typically maps to a segment of a single column (one logical field) that spans a contiguous range of row IDs. One lookup returns a compact, columnar slice: many rows of one column. This reduces round trips, improves cache locality, and speeds up scans.

Above storage, data is addressed by logical field IDs and row-ID ranges for cataloging, planning, and predicate pushdown. The on-disk layout can split a column into multiple physical keys as data grows or is reorganized. The common path stays simple and efficient: one column segment per key, many rows inside. This separation keeps lookups cheap while preserving clear columnar packing on top of a key-value store.
