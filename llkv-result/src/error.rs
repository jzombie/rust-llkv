/// This enum encompasses all failure modes across the LLKV stack, from low-level storage
/// errors to high-level transaction conflicts. Each variant includes context-specific
/// information to help diagnose and handle the error appropriately.
///
/// # Error Handling Strategy
///
/// Errors propagate upward through the call stack using Rust's `?` operator. At API boundaries
/// (e.g., SQL interface), errors are typically converted to user-friendly messages. Internal
/// code can match on specific variants for fine-grained error handling.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// `Error` implements `Send` and `Sync`, allowing errors to be safely passed between threads.
/// This is important for concurrent query execution and transaction processing.
