//! Core type definitions for the columnar storage engine.
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental types used to identify and organize data:
//! - [`LogicalFieldId`]: Namespaced 64-bit identifier for columns
//! - [`Namespace`]: Categories of data (user columns, system metadata, MVCC tracking)
//! - Type aliases for table IDs, field IDs, and row IDs

// FIXME: Since upgrading to `rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)`, this seems
// to be needed to workaround parenthesis errors in `LogicalFieldId`, which
// creep up regardless of comments being added or not. This is possibly a bug
// with Clippy or `modular_bitfield`, or a small incompatibility issue.

/// Globally unique identifier for a column in the storage engine.

/// A `LogicalFieldId` combines three components into a single 64-bit value:
/// - **Namespace** (16 bits): Category of data (user, system, MVCC)
/// - **Table ID** (16 bits): Which table the column belongs to
/// - **Field ID** (32 bits): Which column within the table
///
/// This design prevents ID collisions across different tables and data categories while
/// keeping identifiers compact and easy to pass around.

///
/// ```text
/// |-------- 64 bits total --------|
/// | namespace | table_id | field_id |
/// |  16 bits  | 16 bits  | 32 bits  |
/// ```
///
/// # Construction
///
/// Use the constructor methods rather than directly manipulating bits:
/// - [`LogicalFieldId::for_user`] - User-defined columns
/// - [`LogicalFieldId::for_mvcc_created_by`] - MVCC created_by metadata
/// - [`LogicalFieldId::for_mvcc_deleted_by`] - MVCC deleted_by metadata
/// - [`LogicalFieldId::from_parts`] - Custom construction
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// `LogicalFieldId` is `Copy` and thread-safe.
