# Test nested struct field extraction
# NOTE: Nested STRUCT/ROW types in CREATE TABLE are not yet supported in the SQL parser
# This test is a placeholder for when that feature is added

# For now, we've verified that:
# 1. Single-level struct field extraction works (see struct_field_extraction_test.slt)
# 2. The GetField expression supports nesting in the evaluation code
# 3. SQL parsing creates nested GetField expressions for a.b.c syntax

# Future test when nested struct creation is supported:
# CREATE TABLE nested_test(data STRUCT(outer STRUCT(inner INTEGER)));
# INSERT INTO nested_test VALUES ({'outer': {'inner': 99}});
# SELECT data.outer.inner FROM nested_test; -- should return 99
