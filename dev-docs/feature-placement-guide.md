# Feature Placement Guide

This guide keeps feature work aligned with our architecture so we avoid wasteful refactors and protect runtime performance.

## Know the Stack
- Start with the current linkage diagram in `docs/crate-linkage.md` to understand which crates sit above or below your target area.
- Default to placing new code as low in the stack as it can live **without** sacrificing the performance profile of the higher layers.

## Placement Process
1. Define the featureâ€™s responsibility and data flow.
2. Identify the lowest crate that already owns similar responsibilities.
3. Confirm the crate can expose the needed API without pulling in higher-layer dependencies.
4. If you must stay in a higher layer for performance or ownership reasons, note the exception in the PR description.

## Guardrails
- **Performance first:** moving logic downward must not introduce cross-crate chatter that slows hot paths.
- **No duplicates:** extend existing modules instead of cloning functionality elsewhere. If you catch yourself wiring up the same method signature twice in different files or crates, stop and reassess (the architecture is likely wrong and needs refactoring rather than another copy).
- **No loops:** ensure dependency arrows still point downward; adding a reference that forces a circular dependency is a blocker.
- **Comment hygiene:** follow [comment-style-guide.md](comment-style-guide.md) and tidy nearby comments while you are in the module so style drifts do not accumulate.

## Before You Open a PR
- [ ] Verified that the chosen crate is the lowest layer that satisfies the feature.
- [ ] Reviewed existing modules to avoid re-implementing the same capability.
- [ ] Searched for duplicate implementations of the new API to confirm we are not papering over an architecture problem.
- [ ] Ran benchmarks or targeted tests when performance-sensitive paths are touched.
- [ ] Confirmed Cargo manifests stay acyclic.
- [ ] New dependencies should be treated as workspace dependencies. You never know if another crate might eventually reuse a dependency.
- [ ] Updated the crate linkage diagram if the dependency graph changes.
- [ ] Double-checked all comments in the touched modules against `docs/comment-style-guide.md`, fixing inconsistencies even if they predate the feature.

Keep this checklist close; following it is cheaper than repeating large-scale refactors later.
